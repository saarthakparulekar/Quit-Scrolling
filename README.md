## Purpose 
Sometimes people tend to open youtube with a purpose of learning something or looking for information on a particular concept, but youtube shorts can be distracting and the user can end up in a loop of scrolling shorts continously. 
Installing the extension can help users to focus on their work rather than scrolling mindlessly.
